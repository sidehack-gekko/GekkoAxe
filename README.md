The PCB file opens in gEDA PCB, a free open source software

Not kicad

I don't use kicad. Looked at it once a decade and some ago, tried it out, didn't like it. Found something I did like.

My sources look different from OSMU's because my workflow is different from theirs.

This also means that I didn't start with their project file and modify it. I couldn't open their kicad project file, or the schematics. 
I looked at the gerbers and the bill of materials, backsolved the schematic by hand on paper, measured out a few things for mechanical
compatibility, and started the PCB layout from a blank slate. I kept the parts that were essential for OSMU's AxeOS software to work 
without modification, put important things in the same place, and either redesigned or verified the design of pretty much everything else.

That's why it's still shaped pretty much the same, and works with AxeOS (at least up to 2.10) out of the box, but the electronics are 
actually quite different. The sources are quite different because they were made from scratch in gEDA PCB and my design notebooks, which has
been my process for years and will continue to be my process. It's not a Bitaxe. It's a GekkoAxe, that runs AxeOS.

I also designed two more boards, one with the same XT connector as the stock design, and one using 45W USBC power. The layouts were completed 
and ordered on July 12th and boards were received on July 24th. We'd already decided not to continue this project, as OSMU's publicity engine
had for entirely too long been too openly hostile to outside innovators and anyone that hurt the showrunners' revenue streams. But we were
asked by multiple entities to complete and release the project, to build and sell the gear. So we did. Here it is. You're welcome.
